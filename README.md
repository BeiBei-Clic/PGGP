### PGGP
Pre-trained Model Guided Genetic Programming (PGGP) method is designed to assist the initialization and mutation of GP.





### Getting Started

You should create a new folder 'weights' and download the Transformer weights from https://github.com/SymposiumOrganization/NeuralSymbolicRegressionThatScales/tree/main

Then, run PGGP by:
```
python main.py
```
